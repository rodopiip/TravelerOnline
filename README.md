# TravellerOnline

Final Project

IT Talents Season 15

TravellerOnline is a free web service designed to connect travel enthusiasts and enable them to share their experiences, post comments and interact with other users.

ℹ️ TravellerOnline is currently in development mode, and the database is local. As a result, the web service is not accessible at the moment. Existing bugs are being addressed during this phase. The decision to implement substantial new features is currently under consideration.
